Feature Engineering : This will help us to generate some new columns from existing ones.
-- ---1). Add new column named [time_of_day] --- 
SELECT

        WHEN `time` BETWEEN "12:01:00" AND "16:00:00" THEN "Afternoon"
        ELSE "Evening"
    END) AS time_of_day
FROM sales;

alter table sales
add column time_of_day varchar(20);

update sales 
set time_of_day = (
    CASE
